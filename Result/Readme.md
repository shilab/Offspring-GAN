for plot 1,2,4,6 population labels EAS AMR EUR AFR SAS indicated East Asian, American, European, African, South Asian populations.
for plot 3,5,7 syn prefix is used in labels to distinguish GAN generated datapoints from real data points. 
0,1,2 in each plots represents principle axis 1, 2,3 respectively 
One can use hide/undide feature from the legend to better understand the overlaps and spreads of data points.
