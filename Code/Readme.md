All codes are provided in ipython notebook format. 

Code for developing Offspring GAN is given in Offspring_GAN.ipynb file.
Instructions are provided on how to change first Mendelian Hybridizer to turn it into a Privacy Preserving version of offspring GAN.
Code for camparing output of Offspring GAN, PPO GAN, PG-cGAN with real data is given in Offspring_GAN_results_comparison.ipynb file.
One would need to change the file path strings accordingly for both of the codes. 
One can use the X_train.npy and Y_train.npy from Data.zip directly without the need of preprocessing the raw data. Note that X_train.npy and Y_train.npy is not used directly in training, rather it is used for preprocessing as directed in Offspring GAN.ipnyb file.
Raw data was downloaded from : git@github.com:shilab/PG-cGAN.git url : https://github.com/shilab/PG-cGAN
